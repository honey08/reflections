Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
A: If we want to share our work with other people and allow them to make changes, then we would want to create a
   remote repository. Also creating a remote repository will help us in recovering our repository/work in case of
   accidental deletion of our project from local machine.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: forks: they are used to create a new repository from an existing repository.
   clones: this is used to download a repository to a local machine from github.
   branches: if we want to test a new feature without breaking our existing code, we can make a new branch
   and makes changes there instead on master branch.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: We can check the status of our local branch and remote branch offline and see if any divergence
   has occured.i

q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: Without github, I will mail the code to my collabotors or share it onliine with them, then wait for their
   response. I will also maintain different copies of code locally for my reference. It would be harder.
